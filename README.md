# (Quiz-imi) Flashcards-Program

The Quiz-imi Flashcards Program recreates the popular 'Quizlet' app within Python.
The purpose of the program is to replace Quizlet's usage by high-school or
university students, and potentially working adults looking to learn new skills.
The program seeks to surpass existing flashcard/memorisation programs by
staying lightweight; open-source; offline; and free of paywalls & advertisements.

## Requirements

This Program requires that each iteration/version be downloaded and kept in the exact
file layouts.

## Installation

There are no external dependancies other than the latest version of Python. Inherently,
the program requires the Python files within their respective libraries and modules. 
Auxiliary files, apart from main file, will not run as they are missing the validation 
to check whether it was the __main__ file.

Running the program requires only executing the main file.

## Configuration

None exist currently. Implementation of configuration will be accessed by users
through settings module (to be created by V4-5).

Documentation is available per file for what each tasks are being performed
affects.
